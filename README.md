# Todo Web App

## 🚀 Built a Todo App with Vite + React + Tailwind!

Today, I took a deep dive into React fundamentals by building a Todo App —by focusing on performance, persistence, and state management without external libraries! 💡

### 🛠 Tech Stack & Features:

✅ Tailwind CSS for a sleek and responsive UI.

✅ Local Storage to persist todos even after a page refresh.

✅ Vite + React for a fast, optimized development experience.

✅ useState & useReducer for efficient and scalable state management.

✅ useRef, useMemo, and useCallback for powerful and optimized performance.

✅ pnpm for faster dependency management and reduced storage usage.

### ✨ Key Learnings:

1️⃣ Optimized UI with Tailwind utility classes for rapid styling.

2️⃣ Leveraged useReducer to handle complex state logic cleanly.

3️⃣ Learned how to persist state across sessions using Local Storage.

4️⃣ Improved component structure for better reusability and scalability.

5️⃣ Explored best practices for global state management using Context API, reducing prop drilling.

6️⃣ Used useRef to persist UI state efficiently for theming, todo selection, editing ...etc avoiding unnecessary renders.

7️⃣ Applied memoization and callback API to efficiently handle child components and prevent redundant calculations.

8️⃣ Used pnpm for better performance, efficient caching, and disk space optimization, making dependency management faster than npm.
